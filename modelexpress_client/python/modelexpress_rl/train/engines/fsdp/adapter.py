"""FSDP/DTensor implementation of the trainer-engine adapter contract.

Setup is one-time; the per-step source geometry is re-read from the state_dict
the client passes each stage, so a trainer that re-materializes its state_dict
(CPU offload, gathered state dict) still publishes the latest weights:

- COPY_TO_DEVICE (default): ``initialize`` allocates one persistent wire-dtype
  arena per shard and registers them once. Each stage snapshots the live weights
  into those stable arenas (cast to the wire dtype only when the source differs);
  ``publish_ready`` fences the async copy. Robust to a moving source because the
  registered arena never moves.
- IN_PLACE (optimization): ``initialize`` registers the DTensor local storage
  directly (contiguous, so RDMA-registerable) and serves it with no copy. Its
  premise is stable storage: the registered address must not change, so each
  stage asserts the source still sits where it was registered and fails toward
  COPY_TO_DEVICE otherwise. The source must already be the wire dtype (no
  in-place cast).
