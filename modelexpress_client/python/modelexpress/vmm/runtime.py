"""Engine-agnostic VMM arena lifecycle helpers.

`maybe_enter_vmm_arena(ctx)` is the integration seam each engine adapter
calls around its weight-load envelope. The arena core
(``modelexpress.vmm.arena``, ``backend``, ``hook``, ``_alloc_ext``) only
requires PyTorch's ``CUDAPluggableAllocator`` interface; this module
adds the env-var handling, per-device arena lifetime tracking, and the
``use_arena`` wrapping that every PyTorch-based engine adapter would
otherwise re-implement. Engine modules call into this; this module does
not call back into engine code.

``log_arena_post_load(ctx)`` is the corresponding diagnostic hook that
runs after the load body returns.

    """If ``MX_VMM_ARENA=1`` is set, install a VmmArena hook around the
    load envelope. Otherwise yield without installing anything.

    Engine integration seam. The caller is the engine adapter (vLLM,
    SGLang, TRT-LLM, ...) that owns the load lifecycle; this helper
    handles every step that does not depend on engine internals:

    - reads the ``MX_VMM_ARENA`` env var and warns on stale
      ``MX_VMM_ARENA_BYTES`` / ``MX_VMM_ARENA_CHUNK_BYTES``;
    - probes ``ARENA_AVAILABLE`` (whether the optional
      ``modelexpress.vmm._alloc_ext`` C extension built at install time)
      and yields a no-op fallback when it is unavailable;
    - constructs ``CudaVmmBackend`` and ``VmmArena`` inside
      ``ctx.target_device`` so the backend sees the right CUDA context
      on multi-GPU workers;
    - manages the module-level ``_vmm_arenas`` dict keyed by
      ``ctx.device_id`` and publishes the arena after the wrapped body
      completes successfully;
    - wraps ``vmm.use_arena`` around the yielded scope so allocations
      issued by the engine inside the ``with`` land in the arena's
      bump range.

    The fields read off ``ctx`` (``device_id``, ``target_device``,
    ``global_rank``, ``vmm_arena``) are populated by the engine
    adapter, so this function does not need to know which engine
    invoked it.

    Tunable:
        MX_VMM_ARENA=1                 enable. The only knob.

    The arena reserves 16 TiB of VA per device (VA only, no physical
    commit until cuMemMap). Each ``mx_malloc(size)`` becomes one
    ``cuMemCreate(size_aligned)`` + ``cuMemMap(next_va)`` +
    ``cuMemSetAccess`` at the bump pointer; ``mx_free(va)`` does
    ``cuMemUnmap + cuMemRelease`` on the matching allocation. No
    chunked sub-allocation. PyTorch's caching allocator amortizes
    tensor allocations into pool segments before reaching us, so one
    plugin call == one physical handle.

    End-of-load registration goes through
    ``NixlTransferManager.register_arena``, which calls
    ``cuMemGetHandleForAddressRange`` + ``ibv_reg_dmabuf_mr`` over the
    full bump range and produces one MR for the entire arena.
    ``MX_POOL_REG=1`` remains compatible but is no longer required for
    the single-MR property.

    Lifecycle and failure handling:

    - The arena is constructed inside ``ctx.target_device`` so the
      backend sees the right CUDA context on multi-GPU workers.
    - The arena is published to the module-level ``_vmm_arenas`` dict
      only after the wrapped body completes successfully. If the body
      raises, the freshly created arena is closed and not retained.
    - If ``_vmm_arenas`` already has an arena for this device (second
      load on the same worker), the prior arena is closed before
      installing a new one. Silently corrupts the prior model's tensors
      if any are still in use; we log a WARNING. Hot-swap-safe arena
      lifetime tied to engine teardown is a TODO.
    - PyTorch's caching allocator may not return every freed segment
      to us during load. The bump pointer therefore tracks cumulative
      allocation, not peak live size. With 16 TiB reserved, this is
      bounded only by HBM (we never exhaust VA).
