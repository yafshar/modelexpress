"""How a reshard receiver wires itself to its accelerator.

The receiver's device-specific work - the allocation scope for NIXL-registered
buffers, the per-stage synchronizes, and the backend the transfer manager
registers memory through - all resolve from the constructor's ``device`` rather
than assuming CUDA. These tests pin that wiring for both implemented families.

The transfer-manager assertion is the one that catches a silent regression:
``NixlTransferManager`` defaults to a CUDA backend when none is passed, so
forgetting to hand it the receiver's backend registers XPU memory through CUDA
device calls while every other part of the receiver looks correct.

Nothing here asserts a publisher/target compatibility policy, because the
receiver has none to assert: the rendezvous identity and the shard table carry no
publisher accelerator, so both same-family and cross-family pairings are
unchecked by accelerator family. See the ``TODO(publisher-accelerator)`` in
``receiver.py``.
