"""Extract FSDP/DTensor local shards and describe them as MX reshard sources.

Extracts the rank-local shards from an FSDP ``state_dict`` and emits MX's
engine-neutral manifest (``PublishedTensor`` / ``PublishedShard`` +
``wrap_rendezvous_blob``). HF-name conversion is deliberately NOT done here: the
receiver captures how these trainer-format sources land in the vLLM param layout
(see ``modelexpress_rl/inference/reshard/fsdp``).

Extraction rules (per state_dict tensor, floating point only):
- unsharded (not a DTensor): every rank holds + publishes the full tensor;
  the identical copies across ranks are deduped by box upstream of the
  transfer planner (merge_shard_tables)
- replicated DTensor: same as unsharded
- sharded DTensor: this rank serves its per-dim local box (general: FSDP dim 0,
  tensor-parallel dim 1, or 2-D meshes) via compute_local_shape_and_global_offset
- served as the wire dtype (WIRE_DTYPE), cast into the staging arena for
  COPY_TO_DEVICE only when the source differs
